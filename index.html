      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student that switched around from mechanical engineering to lighting technician and now I am trying to learn how to code.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Honolulu, HI</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>On my free time I enjoy playing video games and working on my cars. I usually play League of Legends, Valorant, and Osu. My daily is a 2006 Subaru Forester that is lowered and my project drift car is my 1991 Nissan 240sx.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am not sure what my dream job would be if I could implement the knowledge that I learn in this coding academy to find a job associated with one of my hobbies that would be ideal.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Walnut which is about 30 minutes from the city. I moved here in 2018 and have been here ever since.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I would like to be a web developer because I feel like it is a fun way to be creative and it is a good stepping stone to get into other types of coding.</p>
